                <h1>Giant Grouper</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>What type of animal is a giant grouper?</h2>
                <p>
                    A giant grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus) is a carnivorous fish of the serranidae family. It is one of the largest reef-dwelling marine fishes known. They are usually found living near reefs in the Indo-Pacific Ocean. Giant grouper lives in the oceans, more specifically the Atlantic Ocean. Giant grouper fish prefer the tropical shallow waters of the ocean where there are rocks or reefs present. Even muddy or sandy waters are frequently inhabited by the giant grouper. Essentially any shallow water environment that allows them to camouflage with their surroundings and ambush their prey is ideal for the giant grouper.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>How many giant groupers are there in the world?</h2>
                <p>
                    Even though there isnâ€™t an exact number for the population of the giant grouper, the reduction in its population is rapid and they are therefore classified as a Critically Endangered species by the IUCN.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>What do giant groupers look like?</h2>
                <p>
                    Giant groupers live for an average of 37 years, but some members of this species are believed to be able to live to the age of 100. Giant groupers are a massive species of fish that can grow as long as 96 in (8 ft). With a fairly thick body, the goliath grouper is quite ugly to look at

                <br>
                <h2>How do they communicate?</h2>
                <p>
                    Giant groupers communicate using their mouths by creating a deep rumble that travels through the water. This is done to communicate with its similar kind, as well as to guard its own territory.

                <h1>Moon jellyfish</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>What type of animal is a moon jellyfish?</h2>
                <p>
                    The moon jellyfish is a type of jellyfish that lives in the ocean. It is an animal that comes under the genus of Aurelia and the Scyphozoa class.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Where does a moon jellyfish live?</h2>
                <p>
                    The moon jellyfish lives in the ocean. They are found in a wide range of ocean habitats around the world. A moon jellyfish habitat is found along the warm coastlines 0f several oceans such as the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean. They usually swim on the surface but whey need to dive, they have the capability to dive up to 90 ft (27.4 m) deep or more.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>How long does a moon jellyfish live?</h2>
                <p>
                    The average moon jellyfish life cycle lasts for between eight to 12 months.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Are they dangerous?</h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, the stinging cells of jellyfish are very dangerous, and their tentacles can cause great damage. Luckily though, they are not harmful enough to kill humans. Whilst simply touching a moon jellyfish will not cause great damage, you will still feel a slight sting, so it is best not to touch them! However, the moon jellyfish sting is used for their own protection as well as there are a lot of marine predators who want to devour them. Their oral arms produce a sting that can cause great damage to predators and to humans.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>How big is a moon jellyfish?</h2>
                <p>
                    The moon jellyfish is 3 in (7.6 cm) tall, 2 -15 in (5 - 38 cm) long, and has a tiny weight that is almost negligible. Technically they weigh between 0.005- 0.07 lb (0.224 - 3.2 g).

                <h1>Pufferfish</h1>
                <br>
                <h2>Are They Deadly?</h2>
                <p>
                    The toxin in the puffer fish, called tetrodotoxin, is found throughout its body, and is actually produced by bacteria, said Dr. Nick Saint-Erne, Certified Aquatic Veterinarian from PetSmart. Puffers that have been raised in a bacteria-free environment experimentally did not produce the toxin in that instance.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>A Puffer Fishâ€™s Teeth Never Stop Growing</h2>
                <p>
                    Many fish species have teeth that stop growing at some point, but puffer fish do not. Because they eat hard foods, they have teeth (also called beaks) that continuously grow throughout their lives, said Claricoates. This makes it paramount to offer your puffer fish food with hard shells to help organically trim their teeth. Without snails or the like, your puffer fish may require veterinary dental attention.

                <h1><h1>Sea horse</h1>
                <p>
                    Seahorses propel themselves by using a small fin on their back that flutters up to 35 times per second. Even smaller pectoral fins located near the back of the head are used for steering.Because of their body shape, seahorses are rather inept swimmers and can easily die of exhaustion when caught in storm-roiled seas.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Seahorses prefer to swim in pairs with their tails linked together. They anchor themselves with their prehensile tails to sea grasses and corals, using their elongated snouts to suck in plankton and small crustaceans that drift by. The seahorse can suck up food from as far as 3cm away.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Seahorses have no teeth and no stomach. Food passes through their digestive systems so quickly, they must eat almost constantly to stay alive. They can consume 3,000 or more brine shrimp per day.

                <h2>Sea Stars Can Regenerate Arms</h2>
                <p>
                    Amazingly, sea stars can regenerate lost arms, which is useful if a sea star is injured by a predator. It can lose an arm, escape, and grow a new arm later. Sea stars house most of their vital organs in their arms. This means that some species can even regenerate an entirely new sea star from just one arm and a portion of the star's central disc. This won't happen too quickly, though; it takes about a year for an arm to grow back.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Sea Stars Do Not Have Blood</h2>
                <p>
                    Instead of blood, sea stars have a circulatory system made up primarily of seawater.
Seawater is pumped into the animal's water vascular system through its sieve plate. This is a sort of trap door called a madreporite, often visible as a light-colored spot on the top of the starfish.
From the madreporite, seawater moves into the sea star's tube feet, causing the arm to extend. Muscles within the tube feet are used to retract the limb.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Sea Stars Move Using Their Tube Feet</h2>
                <p>
                    Sea stars move using hundreds of tube feet located on their underside. The tube feet are filled with seawater, which the sea star brings in through the madreporite on its top side. Sea stars can move quicker than you might expect. If you get a chance, visit a tide pool or aquarium and take a moment to watch a sea star moving around. It is one of the most amazing sights in the ocean.
